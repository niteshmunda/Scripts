How It Works?

This is a python script which will just copy the image files path from the source folder to the destination folder.
Steps to use the script:

1. There will be two "txt" files i.e. source.txt and destination.txt. You have
   to just copy the path of source files of the folder where sketch/zeplin export the image resource or any other image resource folder
   Then in the destination.txt just copy the android studio folder path where it keeps the image resource 
   (for e.g. /Users/dunzo/Documents/DunzoUser/demo/src/main).
2. Then the script will ask you to enter the source folder name where the image is and also the source image name. This image_name will   rename the image name in soruce and destination both (**IMPORTANT  Make sure to write image_name.png**).
3. Then there is a class Constants which have "SOURCE" and "DESTINATION", you have to change these to the path name of this project and   where you cloned or unzipped.
4. Run the script image_to_resouce_path.py. Using command -> [Python3 image_to_resouce_path.py]  in the terminal.
5. You are good to go.

******* RUN THE SCRIPT AND ENJOY *********
